Lucid Chart//
I like the idea of using a flow chart to organize your ideas and have a plan on what needs to be done and what order it needs to be done. I feel like for bigger projects this helps alot because theres so many steps to building a program and the problems usually start from the beginning of the project. So this helps break it down so you and your team can visually see the steps which will help catch mistakes in the beginning. 

Introduction To Networking//
Data transmission//

Packet = This is similar to packet becuase they both use a unit of data transmitted over the internet. They both use send sequences of numbers, and use the senders address, and the destination address to complete the job. 

Packet-Switching = This is relates to data tansmission because data transmission uses signals like wireless communication to transfer data over from one point to another point. Its the same as sending a text over from one iphone to another iphone. 

Ip Address = This is related to data transmission because when you are communicating online or doing anything on the internet your device has a ip address assigned to that device. So when your online visiting sites and just browsing the internet evertime you visit a site or do anything your device is sending its assigned ip address to the servers so the sites and your device can be followed and monitered. 

DNS = This relates to data transmission because when your device is online it is requested access to a device with a domain name and in return the ip address of the device is sent allowing proper routing. 

Protocol = Protocol uses data transmission signals to transfer over data when using computer protocoling. When a device is online it goes through protocol that allow two or more devices to exchange information back and forth across the network. 

Network Hardware//
a) Switches are used on a computer network to phisically connect devices together. You could even add a couple cords to allow networked devices to communicate with each other. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by sending a recieved message to the device for who the message was intended for. With using a switch you can also moniter and identify each device connected to the switch using the mac address, which allows it to control the flow of traffic. This also maximizes security and the effciency of the network. 

b)Routers can connect diffrent networks, like ethernets and token ring. Routers can also choose the best path across an internetwork using advance routing techniqes. Routers also reduce network traffic by creating collision domains and broadcast domains. Routers are best used when you have multiple networks and physically networks in diffrent areas. Routing provides the backbone for many networks because routers regenerate data indefinatly across networks with no degradation.
