Lucid Chart//
I like the idea of using a flow chart to organize your ideas and have a plan on what needs to be done and what order it needs to be done. I feel like for bigger projects this helps alot because theres so many steps to building a program and the problems usually start from the beginning of the project. So this helps break it down so you and your team can visually see the steps which will help catch mistakes in the beginning. 

Introduction To Networking//
Data transmission//

Packet = This is similar to packet becuase they both use a unit of data transmitted over the internet. They both use send sequences of numbers, and use the senders address, and the destination address to complete the job. 

Packet-Switching = This is relates to data tansmission because data transmission uses signals like wireless communication to transfer data over from one point to another point. Its the same as sending a text over from one iphone to another iphone. 

Ip Address = This is related to data transmission because when you are communicating online or doing anything on the internet your device has a ip address assigned to that device. So when your online visiting sites and just browsing the internet evertime you visit a site or do anything your device is sending its assigned ip address to the servers so the sites and your device can be followed and monitered. 

DNS = This relates to data transmission because when your device is online it is requested access to a device with a domain name and in return the ip address of the device is sent allowing proper routing. 

Protocol = Protocol uses data transmission signals to transfer over data when using computer protocoling. When a device is online it goes through protocol that allow two or more devices to exchange information back and forth across the network. 

Network Hardware//
a) Switches are used on a computer network to phisically connect devices together. You could even add a couple cords to allow networked devices to communicate with each other. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by sending a recieved message to the device for who the message was intended for. With using a switch you can also moniter and identify each device connected to the switch using the mac address, which allows it to control the flow of traffic. This also maximizes security and the effciency of the network. 

b)Routers can connect diffrent networks, like ethernets and token ring. Routers can also choose the best path across an internetwork using advance routing techniqes. Routers also reduce network traffic by creating collision domains and broadcast domains. Routers are best used when you have multiple networks and physically networks in diffrent areas. Routing provides the backbone for many networks because routers regenerate data indefinatly across networks with no degradation. 

Network Topologies//
a) The single point of failure is when the central hub or switch fails and it causes all the computers connected to that hub crashes, because all the computers are connected to the central hub with a wire. Since all the computers are connected to its own cable if the hub goes down all the computers will go down. This tends to happen during a star topology.

b) I would prefer to have a wireless mesh instead of a topology because I like the fact that there is no wired which eliminates the headache of having wires everywhere. I also like the fact that when having a wireless mesh it is very redundent. Even if one computer connection fails it will still run and all the computers will still be able to assosiate with each other. All you have to do is set up wireless access point through out a building and it will allow you to connect to the internet even when yoour not near the modem and your computer doesnt neef to be connected to the switch.

NSA/CSS//
The NSA is in charge of the nations most critical information related to the US military and intelligence services. They NSA does global monitering, collection, and processess information and data for other foreign intelligence.

Cybersecurity and Encryption//
Information System Security//
a) Confidentiality = This would impact my job because  when talking online on a online chat you do not know who you are talking to, so you have to follow security steps and be careful so you do not give out valuable information.

Integrity = This plays a role as a amazon employee because as a emplyee you are granted access to amazons data base so you have access to information the consumer never gets to see. So when you go into the database you have to have integrity and not missuse your power. You have to use it the correct way and not try to change the numbers or stocks to do something that unethical. 

Availability = For a company as big as amazon you have to always be able to access information at any given time. Theres so many orders being processed everywhere and all day you have to be able to track everything. Amazon has so many consumers ordering items things are gonna happen and people are gonna have problems so they will be looking for a customer service number and thats when availability comes into play.

b) 1) When I log into facebook it requires a log in authentification. When I log in i have to log into my gmail, becuase my facebook is linked to my gmail. 
2) When i log into my school account at school is another one. This could be converted into the multi factor authentification by having the students use thier phone numbers to log in. Every once in a while when you log in it could have you put in a code to log in that is linked to your phone.

c) ACL is good for giving specific users the capability to read, write, delete, or add. If the user isnt on the list it will not be granted access to the control list capabilities. The downside of using this is when you want to add or remove users from a chunk of information it will be quit difficult. As the resources and the amount of users increase it will start to get more more and difficult to maintaine. So they improved it and created a new based access control called RBAC. With rbac it gives specific users access to certain information. Certain users are assigned roles and those roles are granted access. This will allow the administrator to manage users and roles seperatly, by simplifying addministration, and extending and improving security. 

d) The sender wants to send a message and keep it private so a unautherized user doesnt view it. So the sender sends it as a public key and encrypys the text and send it over to the recipient. As the message is being sent the plaintext is altered which is called ciphertext, which is unreadable. When the recipient recieves it they will have to decrypted with a private key that only the sender and the recipient have. Thats how people send private mesages to one another.  

e) A public key is the most secure protocol, because users never need to reveal thier private keys to other people. In doing so this lessens the chances of a cyber criminals being able to find a indivisuals secret private key and elimainates the key distributing problem. 

Cyber Security and encryption//

a) Cryptogtaphy is a meathod of protecting your information and communicating through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read it. 
The ceasar cipher is a encryption techniques. Its a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters shifted up or down in the alphabet. 
b) Plaintext = The Brown Lazy Dog
   Ciphertext = QEB YOLTK IXWV ALD
   
c)I wrote my name is eli and i like steak and mac and cheese. As i wrote that the letters went up the most freqently i hit a certain key. I think the fingerprints would be diffrent depending on alphabet and language that is being used. 

d) This is like any cipher based substitution using multiple substitution alphabet. When encryting of the original text is done using the Vigenere table. This cipher uses mixed alphabet  to encrypt the plaintext, but at random points it would change to a diffrent mixed alphabet, indicating the change with an uppercase letter in a ciphertext. 

e) Well i wrote hello my name is eli and is like to drink coffee. Then i decrypt the message and it gave me this result "zzzz zz zzzz zz zzz sir w wvlq bbawlz". Then when i encrypted the message I  got thid result " pjxxd zx bbzj rl isp u avjs dbkoxj". Also at the bottem of the screen it displays the all the letters through a - z and it shows all the keys you used the most to type out the secret message. 

Brute force//
A brute force attack is when the attacker tries every possible decryption code for the cipher. Kerckhoffs princible relates to this becuase even if the enemy knows the system the part that keeps the mesage a secret is the key.
