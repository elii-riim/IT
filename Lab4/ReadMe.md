Python IDLE//
Shell = Waits for the imput command from the user and then displays on the screen. 
File Editor = Allows users to create or change plain text compiter files. 

Code Examples//
Varible = A reserved spot for stored value. 
Exp >> f = 1

Assignment statement = A statement that puts a value in a varible.
Exp >> a = 5
>> z = 4 * a

A function = A block of code thats execured when called on. 
Exp >> def square (x)
          print(x * x)
       Print(square(4))
        
Three types of data =
1)Integers is a assigned value that has either a posotive or negative number. Exp >> z = 4

2)Boolean evaluates one or two statements if its true or false. Exp >> 5 < 7. true 
                                                                        7 < 5. false
                                                                        if 5 < 7 :
                                                                        print("Hello World")
                                                                                                                                              
3)Strings a sequence of characters that are defined. Exp >> g = "Hello World" 
                                                            print(g)

Graphics//
Raster vs Vector Graphics  = Raster is composed of pixels used in GIF or JPEG. Vector Graphics are composed of paths if you zoom in into the picture it will look the same. 

Lossless vs Lossy Compression = 1) Lossless reduces a file's size without losing wihtout any loss of thr original quality. But audio and image files will be larger in size than Lossy.
2) Lossy you will lose data quality  from the origial from the original quality. Lossy is usually used when you use Jpeg or mp3 files. 

File Formats//
JPG = Type of compression meathod  that removes color the human eye can not see. Since you are compressing the file the file size will decrease. You should use JPG files if you editing a human portrait or other images where the color vairies. 

GIF = Gifs are used to display a seqence of images similar to videos, but very short few secound clips. GIFS are good if you have limited colors in a picture or for pictures when transparency isnt important. Gifs and Jpegs are similar because they both have the ability to load in segments on web pages.

PNG = Png is simialar to a gif file but has 5 to 25 percent greater compression than a gif and a more broad range of colors compared to a gif file. And with these two files suport transparency but for png files the user can control the varible transparency, which the user can control the degree of transparency.The downside to varible transparency is some older browsers will display the transparency the same.
