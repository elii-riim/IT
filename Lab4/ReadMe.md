Python IDLE//
Shell = Waits for the imput command from the user and then displays on the screen. 
File Editor = Allows users to create or change plain text compiter files. 

Code Examples//
Varible = A reserved spot for stored value. 
Exp >> f = 1

Assignment statement = A statement that puts a value in a varible.
Exp >> a = 5
>> z = 4 * a

A function = A block of code thats execured when called on. 
Exp >> def square (x)
          print(x * x)
       Print(square(4))
        
Three types of data =
1)Integers is a assigned value that has either a posotive or negative number. Exp >> z = 4

2)Boolean evaluates one or two statements if its true or false. Exp >> 5 < 7. true 
                                                                        7 < 5. false
                                                                        if 5 < 7 :
                                                                        print("Hello World")
                                                                                                                                              
3)Strings a sequence of characters that are defined. Exp >> g = "Hello World" 
                                                            print(g)


Graphics//
Raster vs Vector Graphics  = Raster is composed of pixels used in GIF or JPEG. Vector Graphics are composed of paths if you zoom in into the picture it will look the same. 

Lossless vs Lossy Compression =
