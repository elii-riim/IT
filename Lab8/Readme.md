DATA, INFORMATION, AND KNOWLEDGE. 

RELATIONAL DATA ///
i) Data is passed over as information and is a set of representation of facts.
Information is captured data in a information. A photograph is information, but what you look like is data. 
Knowledge is something we know and knowledge is something we attaine and we have experienced fist hand or have a insight of. 

ii) 
1) The primary key to the tables would be the Club ID.
2) The relation between customers and orders table in the Club ID and the order ID. With those two ID's you can cross reference between the two and can match them up. 
3) The foreign key would be the club ID.

iii) Its important to define the data types of a field because the data types of the fields determine what kinds of values you can store in them. 

BIG DATA ///
i) Volume = Volume represents how much data and is the main thing that makes a data "BIG". This refers to how much data is stored in that orginization and trying to improve decision making across the buisness. 
Velocity = This represents the motion of the data. The data movement is now almost now in real time and the update windows has been reduced to the fraction of a secound. This helps buisnessess incorperate steaming data into buisness process and the desion making is better. 
Variety = This defines diffrent types of data and data resources. New categories have been added to the list of data types. 
Veracity = This can be turned as the trustworthiness of the data. This is the reliability associated with specific types of data. 

ii) Predictive Analytics, NoSQL Database, Knowledge discovery tool, and stream analytics. 

STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE ///

a) RDBS stands for relational database management system. This is a databse management system, and SQL is the language used for cumminicating with data in an RDBS. SQL statements are used to perform task such as update data on a database, or retrive from a database. 

b) I picked oders and orders details. The relation between these two is tha the order table represents the orders as of where its going and the specifications of the location. Then the order deails represents the specifications of the items like the discounts and quanitiy of the order. The primary key to these two tables is the order numbers and thats the same for the foreign key. With these two tables the buisness can track orders and keep track of thier inventory as well. 

ETHICAL AND LEGAL IMPLICATION 

CODE OF ETHICS ///
i) The purpose of code of ethics is to provide ans set a common standard univerally for everyone to try to promote a certain standard of behavior. A code governs the action and work relationships of board memebers and top management with employees and in dealing with other stakholders. ACM created this code of ethics so they can run a sussessful buissness. But because this is also a orginization of proffesionals that focuses on computing.

ii) AUP is a document that pretty much says that the user must agree too for access to a corporate network or the internet. Then code of ethics is when there is unwritten rules but theres a standard set of morals and behavior.

iii) The website I used was called cole and son. I read the AUP and the privacy policy the aup pretty much had many rules you had to sign that was about not breaking into thier network, not to steal, not to use thier website to do any type of breaching, and not to upload any type of virus to the network knoeing what it will do. The privacy policy was about who the buisness was, and thier rights if you break any rules and you rights as well. They also explain what they are doing with your information, and how thier getting your information, and how they share information with other third party buisnessess. 

INELLECTUAL PROPERTY ///

i) To promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world through cooperation among the states and where appropiaate in collaboration with any toher internation orginazatio. Also to ensure administative cooperation among the unions. 

ii) To obtain a copy right you have to ensure your work is properly marked, then register your work, register supporting evidence, then agree between co-authors. When you register your work the registration entitles the copyright owner to your work. Also the copyright owner is entitled to seek statutory damages and attorney fees in federal court. I would wanna copright it because there could be a upcoming coffee shop looking for a new logo for thier company and could come across mine and decide to use it and if i copyrighted my svg image i would have to revieve something for them using it or they would have to find something diffrent or go make thier own logo.

iii) Trademark is protected by diffrent type of intellectual property. If the svg image is trademarked or copyrighted it typically protects the brand logo used on goods and services. But your work would have to already be trademarked or copyrighted. You could apply to register a trademark to ptotect the brand name of th vacuum cleaners.
