FILE COMPRESSION ///

a) File compression is usually used when sending a file from one coputer to another over a connection that has limited bandwidth. What the compression basically does is make the file smaller, and therefore sending the file is faster, but when you compress a file it could recduce the image qualitys. 
b) SVG = Is a vector format and works for pretty much any type of image other than a photo. SVG is also a lossless format, so it doesnt lose any data whe compressed and has unlimited number of colors and is most used whe creating a logo or graphics for a website or projects.
JPG = Using jpg you can choose how copressed an image should be from 0 to 100. JPG uses lossy compression and does not maintain orginal data during compression. Everytime a photo is resaved and exported as a jpg it will degrade the photo. There is no transparency, and created jagged edges for text. 

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ///

i) They are using a constructor meathod for the shark, and the properties for the shark are the shark is swimming and the shark is a being awesome. 
ii) A constructor is a kind a meathod that when called it uses the defintion found in your class. Constructors perform task such as initalizing any instance varibles that the object will need when its called upon. 
iii) A class is a pretty much like a template for the objects you are going to create. A class defines a object properties including a valid range of values, and a defult value. A object is simply a collection of data and methods that act on those data. When instantiate and object from a class is when you instantiate an instance of the class and give that instance a name by which you will refer to it whe accessing members and calling meathod. 

ii) A meathod that initializes an object of that type in any object oriented language like python. 

iii) The diffrence between a class and a object is that a class is a template for a object. A class pretty much defines the objects properties including a valid range of values. A object is a collection of data and meathods that act on those datas when called upon. When you instantiate an object you are creating an instance for an object. This is given a name and created memory or on a disk using the structure described within a class declaration.
