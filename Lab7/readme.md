FILE COMPRESSION ///

a) File compression is usually used when sending a file from one coputer to another over a connection that has limited bandwidth. What the compression basically does is make the file smaller, and therefore sending the file is faster, but when you compress a file it could recduce the image qualitys. 
b) SVG = Is a vector format and works for pretty much any type of image other than a photo. SVG is also a lossless format, so it doesnt lose any data whe compressed and has unlimited number of colors and is most used whe creating a logo or graphics for a website or projects.
JPG = Using jpg you can choose how copressed an image should be from 0 to 100. JPG uses lossy compression and does not maintain orginal data during compression. Everytime a photo is resaved and exported as a jpg it will degrade the photo. There is no transparency, and created jagged edges for text.
