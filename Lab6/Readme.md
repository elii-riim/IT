Internet Arvhitecture///

a) Every computer or laptop has a unique identifier to send data to specific computers on a network. All computers use the tcp/ip protocol as the standard for how to commumicate on the network. This is tcp/ip protocol is the unique identifier for a computer which is called a ip address. 
IPv4 uses 32 binanary bits to create a single address on the network. This is expressed by four numbers seperated by dots. example: 216.27.61.137
IPv6 uss 128 binary bits to create a single unique addess for a network. This address is expressed by eight group of hexidecimal base -16 numbers seperated by colons. Groups of numbers thaat contain all zeros are often omitted to save space, leaving a colon seperator to mark the gap. 

c) ICANN is a buisness that was formed in 1998 it is a nonprofit company that partershiped with people all over the world to dedicate to keep the internet secure, stable and interiperable. ICANN doesnt control the internet, but rather they promote competitions and developed policys on the internet unique identifiers. They help define how the domain name system function and expands. 

TCP/IP ///

i) When isolatinf network communication functioons in diffrent layers gets minimizes the impact of technological change in the entire protocol suite. Also when creating a new application it can be added without changing the phisical network. When you have a new network hardware it can be installed without rewriting the application software. 

ii) Some type of applications that run layers is applications is virtual machines, network data sharing, web surfing, file transfer, and web chats. 

Internet Security///

a) when creating a web application you use HTTP it is a layered protocol works on the client server. When the client request for the html pages towards the server, the server then respondes with the html. SO the client request pages and objects through its agent and the server respondes them with the request objects sby display. 

b) Here are the protocols for securing http. First set up a cipher suites. Next authenticating both servers and the client side. Then exchange symmetric sessions keys. 

Securing your web browser///

a) There is an increase of threats from software attacks that take advantage of vulnerable web browsers. Mnay users have a tendency of clicking on links without thinking about the risk that come along with clicking the link. Web page address can be disguised or take you to a risky website. Also many users do not know how to configure thier own web browser securly. 

b) One of the risk is attackers focus on exploiting the client side systems through various vulnerabilitys. They prey on users who are not very tech savy and they try to attack them because they are just vulnerable. These vulnerabilities are to take control of your computer, steal your information, destroy your files, and even use your computer to attack other computers. Also rather than activley targeting and attacking  vulnerable systems, a malicous website can passivly compromise systems as the site is visited. Attackers also can send a html document can also be emailed to victims. And if the user decides to open the html it can compromise the users computer system. 

Internet Programming ///

a) Tim Berners-Lee inventer of the world wide web. The world wide web was created to originally concieved and develope to meet the demand for automatic information sharing between scientist in the universities and the institutions around the world. 

b) I feel as if web desighn and applivation is pretty impotant, because this part of the creating process is what the user is going too see and it is the visual part of the program or the webpage. This is what everyone is going too see. Its not the most important part but it is imortant because if your web designing looks basic or unproffesional its not going to be attractive to your users visting your webpage or using your application. 

HTML and XML ///
i) XML is a mark up language but it does not display anthing on the screen like how html does. The diffrence between xml and html is that xml is meant to send/recieve data and tags are not predifined like html. Then html is used to display data onto the screen for you to see.

Components of a URL ///
Scheme = Scheme goes with https because a scheme is a address that tells your browser where to go too. But typically a web browser will take you too a http or a https.

Domain = Domain goes with result of search because when you search up a website you will see the same domain name of the webpage for all the diffrent pages of the site.

Top level domain = Top level domain assosiates with .edu because when you go on too a website and you look at the domain and look at the end of it will say .com, .gov, and edu or something along those lines. This identifies what kind of website it is.

Parameters = Parameters goes with no file path because after you look at the domain there will be a long line part of the url with random letters, numbers, and symbols that beguins with a question mark  which the parameter string. 

Anchor = A anchor is at the end of url and what this does it tells your browser where to scroll or load a specific part of the website you are visiting it is pretty much used as a bookmark for a website.
